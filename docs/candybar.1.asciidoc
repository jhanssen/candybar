candybar - WebKit-based status bar for tiling window managers

Synopsis
--------

*candybar* [*-d*] [*-c* _config-file_] [*-h* _height_] [*-m* _monitor_] [*-p*
 _position_] [*-t* _theme-uri_]

Description
-----------

*candybar* displays a HTML-based status bar in a WebKit web view. It provides a
smooth looking status bar with CSS transitions and effects, and the possibility of
having a transparent background with effects without a desktop compositor running.

Screenshots are available on the
https://github.com/Lokaltog/candybar/wiki/Screenshots[candybar wiki].

Options
-------

*-d*:: Enable debugging mode and display the WebKit inspector window on launch.

*-c* _config-file_:: Read configuration options from the specified
_config-file_. config-file overrides _CANDYBAR_CONFIG_PATH_ and any system-wide and
per-user configuration files. The file must exist and be valid JSON.

*-h* _height_:: Set the height of the status bar in pixels.

*-m* _monitor_:: Define which monitor the status bar appears on.

*-p* _position_:: Set the status bar position. Valid options are _top_ and _bottom_.

*-t* _theme-uri_:: Set the URI for a theme HTML file. Must be a valid URI, i.e. local
files must be prefixed with _file://_.
